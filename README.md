# Paulo's Configuration Repository

## Welcome
Hi there! This repository contains all my personal configurations for setting up development environments on any machine I use. I've optimized these settings for my workflow, but feel free to adapt them to your needs.

## Neovim Setup

### Introduction
In this section, you'll find everything you need to get started with my Neovim setup. It's tailored to enhance coding efficiency and comfort.

### Requirements
- **Neovim** (version 0.9.0 or higher) - It needs to be compiled with **LuaJIT**.
- **Git** (version 2.19.0 or higher) - Necessary for partial clones.
- **[LazyVim](https://www.lazyvim.org/)** - I use this to manage my plugins and configurations efficiently.
- A **[Nerd Font](https://www.nerdfonts.com/)** (version 3.0 or higher) is optional but recommended for icon display.

### Plugins I Use
- **[nvim-treesitter](https://github.com/nvim-treesitter/nvim-treesitter#requirements)**: For better syntax highlighting, it requires a C compiler.
- **[lazygit](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit)**: A simple UI for Git, integrated into Neovim. This is optional.
- For searching and navigating files, I use **[telescope.nvim](https://github.com/nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim)** with:
  - **[ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep)** for live grep,
  - **[fd](https://github.com/sharkdp/fd)** for finding files.

### Theme
- I'm currently using the **[Tokyo Night](https://github.com/folke/tokyonight.nvim)** theme. It’s easy on the eyes, making it great for both day and night coding.

### Recommended Terminals
- **[kitty](https://github.com/kovidgoyal/kitty)** and **[wezterm](https://github.com/wez/wezterm)** are fantastic on Linux and macOS.
- **[alacritty](https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty)** and **[iterm2](https://iterm2.com/)** are also top choices for a seamless experience with full color support.
