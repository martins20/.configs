## Neovim Setup 🛠️

### Dive into My Environment
Prepare to elevate your coding experience with my meticulously curated Neovim setup. It’s crafted to boost productivity and enhance code clarity.

### Prerequisites 📋
- **Neovim (v0.9.0+)**: Ensure it’s compiled with **LuaJIT** for optimal performance. 🚀
- **Git (v2.19.0+)**: Required for leveraging partial clones. 🔄
- **[LazyVim](https://www.lazyvim.org/)**: My go-to for managing plugins and configurations seamlessly. 🧰
- A **[Nerd Font](https://www.nerdfonts.com/)** (v3.0+): Optional but recommended for full icon support. 🎨

### Essential Plugins 🔌
- **[nvim-treesitter](https://github.com/nvim-treesitter/nvim-treesitter#requirements)**: Enhances syntax highlighting and requires a C compiler. 🌈
- **[lazygit](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit)**: Simplifies Git operations within Neovim. Optional but incredibly handy. 🌐
- **[telescope.nvim](https://github.com/nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim)**: Powers my file searches and code navigation, utilizing:
  - **[ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep)** for dynamic grep capabilities, 🔍
  - **[fd](https://github.com/sharkdp/fd)** for efficient file finding. 📁

### Aesthetic Touch 🎨
- **Theme**: Currently, I’m all about the **[Tokyo Night](https://github.com/folke/tokyonight.nvim)** theme. It’s visually stunning and perfect for long coding sessions.

### Terminals of Choice 🖥️
- **[kitty](https://github.com/kovidgoyal/kitty)** and **[wezterm](https://github.com/wez/wezterm)** on Linux and macOS deliver exceptional performance.
- **[alacritty](https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty)** and **[iterm2](https://iterm2.com/)** round out my top picks for their robust color support and smooth integration.
